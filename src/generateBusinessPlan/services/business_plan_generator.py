    prompt = f"""You are an AI assistant specialized in agricultural business planning. Your task is to generate a detailed agricultural business plan based on the provided data. The plan should be comprehensive, data-driven, and tailored to the specific crops, soil conditions, weather, and budget provided.

Please generate a detailed agricultural business plan with the following sections. For each section, provide a long, well-explained paragraph of at least 150 words. The output should be in JSON format with two main dictionaries: BP (for the paragraphs) and variables (for calculated metrics):

1. Executive Summary: Provide a brief overview of the entire plan.

2. Resources: Discuss the recommended number of workers, affordable workers based on the budget of ${budget}, suggested machines for the crops ({', '.join([crop['name'] for crop in crops_data])}), recommended pesticides, soil vitamins, and products based on the soil parameters ({soil_params}), and potential farm improvements.

3. Crops: For each crop ({', '.join([crop['name'] for crop in crops_data])}), discuss best practices for soil preparation, crop maintenance, growth maintenance tips, and recommended area and budget allocation.

4. Weather: Based on the weather data ({weather_data}), suggest best measures to ensure high revenue and protective measures for the crops.

5. Soil/Crops Maintenance: Provide a detailed maintenance schedule, including watering frequency and amount, fertilization schedule, and pest control measures.

6. Profits: Discuss expected numbers and total investment returns based on the crop data ({crops_data}), and suggest procedures to improve profitability.

7. Other Recommendations: Provide additional suggestions to improve growth, land use, or investment returns.

In the 'variables' dictionary, include the following calculated metrics:
- Human Coverage: Ratio of workers the farmer can afford to workers needed
- Water Availability: Ratio of water available in the area to water needed
- Land Use: Ratio of area used (sum of crop areas) to total area ({total_area})
- Pesticides Levels: Percentage of pesticides recommended for the crop types
- Distribution Optimality: Percentage of how optimal the space between crops is

Please ensure all output is in valid JSON format."""
